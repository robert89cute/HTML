    <h3>Trees</h3>

<p>I think that I shall never see<br>
A poem lovely as a tree.</p>
<p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br>
    Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;</p>
<p>A tree that looks at God all day,
    <br>And lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>
<p>A tree that may in Summer wear<br>
    A nest of robins in her hair;</p>
<p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
<br>Who intimately lives with rain.</p>
<p>Poems are made by fools like me,
    <br>But only God can make a tree.</p>

        <li>500 grams tomato sauce</li>
        <li>225 grams banana ketchup</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon ground pepper - adjust as needed</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Cook spaghetti noodles as per package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, add oil and butter and cook over medium heat until butter is melted. Once melted, add garlic<br>
            and onions and cook until tender and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and cook while stirring and breaking the lumps until it is no longer pink, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the hotdogs and cook for 2 minutes while stirring and turning them from time to time.</li>
        <li>Stir in the corned beef and cook for 1 minute. Add the carrots, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Cook for a minute<br>
            while stirring to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomato sauce and banana ketchup and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 5-7 minutes or until<br>
            the carrots are cooked. You may add a half cup of water if the sauce is getting too thick.</li>
        <li>Grate half of the block of the cheese on top of the sauce and cook for another 1-2 minutes while stirring to melt<br>
            the cheese completely.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked spaghetti noodles and toss until completely covered in sauce. Transfer to a serving plate and<br>
            add more grated cheese on top.</li>
